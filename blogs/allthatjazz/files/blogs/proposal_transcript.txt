To William Northwood,

29th August 1851

My dear friend,
I pray this letter has found you safe, as I fear my own life at the present
time.  The weight of your share is too heavy a burden for me, I must
be light of foot, my pursuers are not one day behind.  Hence, I have hidden
it, though I did not think it wise to place it so near a road, lest it
be stumbled upon by an unwelcome visitor.

As you head due south from the road, you shall see a valley to your right.
Take care as you descend into the valley, it is quite steep.  As you descend,
you will notice a concave rocky escarpment at the head of the valley.  Find your
way down to its base, and, facing back whence you came, you will notice an
overhang, if it were but a little larger it would be a cave.  Look for my
inscription on the wall, for under it you shall find your share.

Upon reaching Lithgow I shall intrude upon the hospitality of my cousin, where
I shall lie low until the Spring.  I please myself with the hope of finding
you comfortably settled in Sydney on my return.  You will not judge me by the
haste of my letter, but believe me to be very sincerely your affectionate
friend,
Edward Hargraves
