My trip is now starting to come to an end.  After my last blog entry, I spent
a night in Mai Sai, took a bus to Chiang Rai, and then stayed there the night.
Chiang Rai was kinda boring, I got a 2 hour massage, and then wandered around
for a while.  The night markets were good though, I bought a few last pressies
for various people.  One big thing I've noticed is the further north you go in
Thailand, the less and less English you see.  In Bangkok, everything's in
English and Thai.  But, there were hardly any English signs in Chiang Rai or
Mai Sai.  There is also a much larger population of Chinese in the north, a
lot of the markets have chinese food in them, and a lot of the restaurants,
particularly the more western ones, are owned by Chinese.<p class="paragraph"/>The next day we took the bus to Chiang Mai, where I had one last walk around,
had lunch, and sat in a cafe reading the paper, before we took the overnight
train to Bangkok.  There were hardly any people on the train, compared to our
first train ride which was full.  So, there was nothing really much to do and
I got an early night at 7pm.  The train arrived in Bangkok at 6am, where I
took a taxi back to the Khao San Road, and checked into a hotel.  So now I'm
here, and I'm waiting for everything to open before I go out and explore.  I
think I'll take a river boat ride again, seeing as I missed out on my last
one.<p class="paragraph"/>Tomorrow I'll be departing from the new international airport in Bangkok.  It
is said to have the largest terminal in the world, and once all its extensions
are finished, will be the biggest airport in the world, handling 100 million
passengers a year.  There have been big problems with its opening 2 days ago
though.  People were waiting for hours for their baggage, and apparently 200
items got sent to the wrong destination.  The problem was due to the fact that
they didn't transfer enough baggage wagons from the old airport to the new.
There were also computer problems for Thai Airways, but seeing as I'm
traveling with British Airways, that won't be a problem.<p class="paragraph"/>Haven't seen any tanks, or any soldiers for that matter, since coming into
Bangkok.  Maybe, just as the coup appeared overnight when I was on the train
to Chiang May, disappeared overnight on the way to Bangkok.  Or maybe it just
never happened.  Hopefully I can find some tanks today to have my picture
taken with.
