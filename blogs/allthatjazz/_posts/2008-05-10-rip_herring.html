#herring, the long standing meeting place for many of ANU's 2004 software engineering graduates, has passed away.  Born in 2002, on the Australian IRC network oz.org, #herring has been a lively channel for keeping in contact, arguing about meaningless topics, and a nice distraction from a busy days work.  #herring, the solid backbone of a friendship group, you will be missed.
