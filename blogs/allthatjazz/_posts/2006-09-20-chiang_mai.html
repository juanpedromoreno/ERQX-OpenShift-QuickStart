Well, what a cool trip this is turning out to be.  I can say that I was in a
country which was a constitutional monarchy one day, and a dictatorship the
next.  That sounds all very exciting, but really, it's not.  Here in Chiang
Mai, 12 hours train ride north of Bangkok, everything is normal.  No ones
uneasy or upset, life just continues on as normal.  The only difference is that
apparently, and I haven't seen them, there are military personel on the streets
with automatic weapons.  Unfortunately, it looks like it will have an impact on
our tour, in 3 days we were hoping to cross the border into Burma for half a
day, but the northern borders have been sealed.  My tour guide has said there
is absolutely nothing to worry about, and everyone believes that this will be
peacefully resolved.  I've seen the transmissions on tv, the military appears
to have every intention to hand control back to the people as soon as
possible.<p class="paragraph"/>Anyway, onto my trip.  Yesterday we took a 5 hour bus trip to Ayutthaya.
Ayutthaya used to be the capital of Thailand, 250 years ago.  Then the Burmese
came through and destroyed every temple.  So the king packed up and went to
Bangkok.  So, yesterday we went to the ruins of two major temples.  They were
quite amazing, these buildings were 700 years old.  All the budhas had had
their heads smashed off.<p class="paragraph"/>In the evening we boarded the overnight train to Chiang Mai.  Here we met the
rest of my tour group for the next 6 days.  Up until now it's been 3 of us, but
now it's 15.  Out of the 12 new people, 6 of them are Mexican exchange students
studying at Macquarie University.  The rest are Aussies, a young couple from
the central coast, a girl from Newcastle, and the rest from Sydney.  They're a
pretty good group, everyones easy going, so there's no disagreements in what to
do etc.<p class="paragraph"/>We stayed up reasonably late partying in the dining car, a lot of backpackers
were on this train from a large number of different countries.  I've never had
so much fun on a train before!  I had just enough alcohol to put my straight to
sleep, usually I don't sleep on trains but this time, no problems.<p class="paragraph"/>We arrived in Chiang Mai at around 9am, went to the hotel, and then we went to
the jewelery and silk factories.  We got to see them make the jewelery and
the silk, and I picked up some good bargains for presents for my family.  After
that we went to one of the temples, a big one up in the mountains.  It was very
ornate, but temples aren't really my sorta thing.
