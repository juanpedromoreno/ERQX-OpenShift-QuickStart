Today I decided to have a go at diagnosing why the reversing lights on my car weren't working.  I quickly worked out that the bulbs were fine, so I jumped on Google to see if I could find some information about where else problems may occur with reversing lights in a car.  I found some very detailed instructions, but I had a problem.  These instructions were on my computer, in my room, but I wanted to take them to my car, in my garage, and I don't have a printer.  However, I do have an iPhone, so I thought I'd copy the URL into my iPhone and read the instructions from Safari.  The URL however was rather long and copying by hand would have been painful, what I really wanted to do was the equivalent of copy and paste from my computer to my iPhone.

Enter <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2780">Mobile Barcoder</a>.  Mobile Barcoder is a Firefox extension that allows you to generate QR Codes from Firefox.  A QR Code is a 2D barcode designed to be read particularly by mobile devices.  Using Mobile Barcoder, generating a barcode for the current page is as simple as hovering your mouse over the icon it puts in the bottom right corner of the window:
</p>

<a class="image_link" href="images/blogs/barcode/currentpage.png"><img src="images/blogs/barcode/currentpage_thumbnail.png" alt="Generating a barcode from the current page"/></a>

<p>
You can also right click on a link to generate a barcode for that link:
</p>

<a class="image_link" href="images/blogs/barcode/link.png"><img src="images/blogs/barcode/link_thumbnail.png" alt="Generating a barcode from a link"/></a>

<p>
You can even create a barcode from arbitrary text on the page, by selecting it and then right clicking:
</p>

<a class="image_link" href="images/blogs/barcode/selection.png"><img src="images/blogs/barcode/selection_thumbnail.png" alt="Generating a barcode from selected text"/></a>

<p>
So I have my barcode, but what use is that to me?  Enter <a href="http://www.beetagg.com/en/beetagglabs/beetaggforiphone/beetagg-reader-for-iphone-qr-code-datamatrix-120.html">BeeTag</a>.  BeeTag is a free iPhone App that reads QR Codes and other 2D barcodes, and, depending on the type of code, lets you act on it accordingly.  For example, if it's a phone number, you can dial the number, if it's a URL, you can open it in Safari, or if it's plain text, you can save it as a memo.  Scanning is as easy as taking a picture:
</p>

<a class="image_link" href="images/blogs/barcode/beetag-picture.png"><img src="images/blogs/barcode/beetag-picture_thumbnail.png" alt="Taking a picture of a barcode with BeeTag"/></a>

<p>
Having taken the picture, it will read it, and then prompt you for what you want to do next.  I chose to open the URL in Safari:
</p>

<a class="image_link" href="images/blogs/barcode/beetag-prompt.png"><img src="images/blogs/barcode/beetag-prompt_thumbnail.png" alt="BeeTag prompt after successfully reading a barcode"/></a>
<a class="image_link" href="images/blogs/barcode/beetag-open.png"><img src="images/blogs/barcode/beetag-open_thumbnail.png" alt="The webpage on my iPhone in Safari"/></a>

<p>
Now all I need to do is wait for the iPhone 3.0 firmware with copy and paste, and I have full end to end copy/paste from my computer to my iPhone.
