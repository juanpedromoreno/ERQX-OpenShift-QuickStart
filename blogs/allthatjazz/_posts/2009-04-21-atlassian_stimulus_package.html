For five days only, you can buy 5 user licenses of the full versions of JIRA and Confluence for only $5.  This includes full support for a year, and renewal will only ever cost you $5.  Furthermore, all revenue raised from the promotion goes to charity.  What a great way for small teams to sneak Confluence and JIRA into their companies!  It's also great for people that want them for personal use but would like a few more than 2 users.
