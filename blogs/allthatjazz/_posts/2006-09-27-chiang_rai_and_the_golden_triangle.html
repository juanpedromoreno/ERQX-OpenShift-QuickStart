How does deep friend silk worms, bamboo worms and crickets sound?  Well, last
night I tried them all.  for about 60c I got a platter of them with chilli
sauce, mmm....  The taste was ok, but the texture&#8230;  A taste was enough, I
went and got some prawn cutlets, spring rolls and basil chicken.  That was last
night in Chiang Rai.<p class="paragraph"/>Today we took a local bus to the Golden Triangle.  The Golden Triangle is the
intersection between the borders of Thailand, Laos and Burma.  I'm told it used
to be the opium capital of South East Asia.  The Laos border is defined by the
Mekong River.  I was amazed at just how much water is flowing down this river.
It is wider than Lake Burley Griffen, looks quite deep, but it's flowing at
quite a rapid pace, too fast to swim against.  It flows down from the
Himalayas.<p class="paragraph"/>We crossed the Mekong and landed at Laos, though, it was only a large island on
the river, no border control or anything.  Nevertheless, there was a Laos post
box there, and I sent a postcard to my parents from there, therefore I was in
Laos.  Something weird there was that the people put snakes - king cobras, and
scorpians, in their whiskey.  There were all these whiskey bottles with snakes
and scorpians in them.  I didn't try it.<p class="paragraph"/>After that we went to Mae Sai, the northern most point of Thailand.  It is here
that we crossed into Burma.  This time, we did have to officially leave
Thailand, pay $13 for a visa into Burma, and then get a new visa when we came
back into Thailand.  Burma was a huge contrast to Thailand.  The streets were
covered in mud, I almost slipped over it was that muddy.  In the worst parts,
the mud had been scooped up into piles on the roads, and drivers had to weave
between the piles.  The people were very poor, there were a lot of beggars,
particularly young children, much more than in Thailand.  In Thailand, there
are little food stalls everywhere, in Burma, there were hardly any, and they
were much more dirty and run down.<p class="paragraph"/>We went shopping in the markets, the people were much more persistent in trying
to sell us things, particularly cigarettes, porn movies and viagra.  They'd
follow you all the way down the street, not like Thailand at all.  Coming back
into Thailand, I was amazed at how clean it was.  Previously I had been
thinking Thailand was quite dirty, but now that I'm back here, I look around
and it's so clean.  It just goes to show the cleanliness of a place is all
relative.
