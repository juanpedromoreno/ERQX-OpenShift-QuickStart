One of the best experiences I've had so far on this trip was doing a Thai
cooking course.  No one from my tour wanted to do it, instead I ended up doing
it with an Intrepid group, there were 6 of us in all.  We started off by going
to the markets and buying most of the ingredients needed for what we were
cooking.  Our instructor explained to us what the different spices were, and
showed us different vegies, and taught us how to recognise which ones were good
and which weren't.  We also saw them make coconut cream and coconut milk fresh
for us.<p class="paragraph"/>At the cooking course, I made pad thai, thai spicy soup, green curry, and
banana in coconut milk.  The food was amazing, best Thai food I've had in
Thailand!  It was also incredibly quick to cook, I never realised it was so
quick to make Thai food properly.  When I get back to Australia I am definitely
seeking out all the ingredients to make the food, it's almost as quick as
unfreezing the frozen meals I usually make.
