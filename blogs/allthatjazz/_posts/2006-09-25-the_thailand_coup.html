Rather than saying bits and pieces about the Coup in my blog entries, I thought
I'd make one blog entry that I'll graduatally add to with all my thoughts on
the Coup, that way the rest of my blog can stay unpolitical.<p class="paragraph"/>I've seen a bit of what the Australian media and the Australian government has
been saying about the coup.  The official advisory said diplomats shouldn't
send their kids to school, other things have said that people should stay
indoors, keep away from busy areas and don't take any photos or do any filming.
I think the coup leaders are justified in being upset with the foreign media
for saying things like that.<p class="paragraph"/>Today, I saw on the front cover of the Bangkok Post, Thailands biggest English
newspaper, a photo of a kid dressed in kahki gear, holding a toy gun, posing in
front of one of the tanks.  If there was any issue with taking photos in public
places, a photo like that would never have made it to the front page of a local
newspaper.  Rather, I think the coup leaders are very happy for images like
that to be posted, because they want everything to be as transparent as
possible.<p class="paragraph"/>I read that a survey of 1550 random Bangkok residents, <span class="nobr"><a href="http://www.bangkokpost.net/News/25Sep2006_news02.php,">&#104;ttp://www.bangkokpost.net/News/25Sep2006_news02.php,</a></span> showed that something
like 97% of residents welcomed the coup, while around 90% were "comfortable"
with the military presence, and around 80% said it made them feel "safe".
Being here on the ground in Thailand, I completely agree.  There is nothing
intimidating about the military presence, they are all very friendly, and they
want everything to be as smooth as possible.  My impression is that they regret
that things have come to this, and so want to do everything they can to avoid
any inconvenience to residents and especially tourists.  Indeed, while we have
such a strong military presence in and around the place, and in light of the
recent terrorist attacks, I would say that Thailand is a safer place.<p class="paragraph"/>As for whether the coup is right or wrong.  I read a very interesting opinion
column in the Bangkok Post this morning: <span class="nobr"><a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/25Sep2006_news15.php.">&#104;ttp://www.bangkokpost.com/News/25Sep2006_news15.php.</a></span>  The writer argued that the
reasons for the coup were all right, but morally, the coup was wrong.  I think
I have to agree with the writer.  It is however, very easy for us, knowing
nothing of Thai politics, to simply say because it is a coup, it is wrong.  One
thing I've noticed since coming to Thailand, is that Thai people are very
smart, and very friendly.  This is not a third world country, where the people
don't know what is good for them.  Many of them are educated, and they have a
very strong desire to help out others.  Anytime I was looking unsure or lost,
someone would ask me if I needed help.  And, they are definitely not a violent
group of people.  Many of them are very religious, strong Budhists, and believe
strongly that what goes around comes around.<p class="paragraph"/>So here we are in Thailand, a non violent country, with a military coup that is
welcomed.  That in my opinion is a very strong sign.  If there was any shred of
doubt in these people that a military coup was a bad thing, you would think
they wouldn't welcome it, that they would strongly oppose.  Rather, we see that
soldiers are given flowers and cold drinks on the street.<p class="paragraph"/>So, my overall opinion of this coup, is that while it is sad that it came to
this, it is not a bad thing.  I can't comment on the cause, because I am not
Thai, but I trust the Thai peoples judgment that it was necessary.  And
certainly, from what I have seen on the streets, I have every confidence in the
coup leaders will resolve it quickly and peacefully.
