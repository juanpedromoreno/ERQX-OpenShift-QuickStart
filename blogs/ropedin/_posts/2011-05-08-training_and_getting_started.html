Our departure date is fast approaching and we are getting excited as the reality of our short term mission kicks in.  This past month God has challenged us and our world view, and we're looking forward to what he has in store for us.

<h2>Missions Interlink Short-Term Training</h2>

<p>
In April we did the the <a href="http://www.missionsinterlink.org.au/node/1055">MIST</a> training course.  We both found this course very helpful.  The training was very practical, covering a large variety of topics including aspects of culture shock, reverse culture shock and reentry, sharing the gospel across cultures and working in international teams.
</p>

<p>
We found it particularly helpful to network with other short term missionaries.  It was very encouraging to hear other like minded peoples passion for seeing God's kingdom all over the world.  One of the things we were challenged in is ensuring that what we do doesn't just become a working holiday.  This is something we have to take particular care in because many people at our age go to Europe to work for a year so they can see Europe.  However, we want to, wherever we are, live our lives for the soul purpose of glorifying God.  We have an awesome opportunity to do this being a part of Mavuno Berlin, but only if we keep our eyes focused on Christ.

<h2>Departure Date</h2>

<p>
We are very close to booking our flights.  James has notified his company of his intentions, and they have requested that he stay till the end of July, as half of his team at work is taking annual leave during July.  So, we're going to book flights for early August.
</p>

<h2>German Gebetsnacht</h2>

<p>
On the 13th of April we had a prayer and information night.  In our rush to get there on time, we forgot to bring the church key!  Nevertheless, in spite of the cold, we met outside the church and had a great evening sharing about our mission, and praying.  The prayer time we found particularly encouraging, we've found meeting up with people that share a passion for mission to be very uplifting.  God is much bigger than us, and can work far more amazing things than we can imagine.  Through your prayers he will work in Germany, in spite of our small cultural and language understanding.
</p>

<h2>Prayer Points</h2>

<p>
Please pray that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>our trip to Germany would not be a working holiday, but that we would remember why we are there and serve God with all our heart and soul</li>
<li>God would help Beth with the large study workload that she has in the final month of her masters</li>
<li>God would give James the words to say as he answers questions from his work colleagues of why he is going to Germany</li>
<li>God would give the people in Berlin that we will be ministering to a thirst for something more in life than what the world has to offer.</li>
</ul>

Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
