After two days travel we have finally arrived in Frankfurt, as we write this we are on the 5 hour train ride to Berlin. Our experience so far has been fun but dampened a little by James getting migraines on each of the plane trips - from Sydney to Seoul and Seoul to Frankfurt. Nevertheless today we enjoyed walking around Frankfurt, soaking in the culture and trying out our German.
</p>

<p>
We've been strongly aware of how, while German culture is at face value very similar to Australian culture, there are many subtle differences that make every experience slightly awkward in some way. At current this is a novelty which we both thoroughly enjoy, but we are sure that in time the novelty will wear off and culture shock will set in.

<em>
Thank God that:
</em>
<ul>
<li>we arrived safely in Germany with our luggage and without issue</li>
<li>we are finding our German is adequate for all communication so far</li>
</ul>

<em>
Pray that:
</em>
<ul>
<li>we would be prepared for the culture shock as it comes</li>
<li>we would jump at opportunities to practice our German</li>
<li>James would be prepared for his job interviews next week</li>
<li>opportunities would arise for Beth to get a job</li>
</ul>
