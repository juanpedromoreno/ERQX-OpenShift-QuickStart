We have now been in Berlin for two weeks and a lot has happened.
</p>

To our surprise, Pastor Oscar Muriu from Nairobi Chapel was passing through Berlin, so we got to spend a day of site seeing with him as well as hear from him for two evenings.  We were very encouraged by what he had to say to us and the rest of the team at the church, and we were able to get some clarity as to how Beth and I will be serving in the church.  We feel that at current our primary focus should be in supporting Dan and Nancy, by helping baby sitting Ferdinand, doing house work, praying for them and ensuring they get plenty of time to maintain their marriage.  Relationships are a key area that Satan attacks in order to frustrate the work of the church, and so it is very important that we ensure that Dan and Nancy don't burn out, that they have plenty of time for each other as well as for the church.

James was fortunate enough to have been offered two jobs within a week of arriving in Berlin.  He has accepted a position at VZ Network, a German social networking site akin to Facebook.  The language used to communicate at VZ is German, though the work itself is mostly in English, so James has his language learning cut out for him.  Part of the package included intense language classes, which James has already started.

Beth has enrolled in a 2 month intensive German course at the Goethe-Institut.  She starts on Monday, and will be attending 4 hour classes 5 days a week.  In the afternoons she will also be helping Nancy with babysitting.

We have both bought ourselves bikes and are enjoying using these in combination with public transport.  Bike is a very common and convenient form of transport in Berlin.  Many roads have bike lanes, and for those roads that don't, bikes are considered first class citizens on the road and are respected by motorists, which makes it much safer than riding on the road in Australia.  Our bikes have made us far more mobile, we are able to go shopping more regularly, get to the train station with ease, and visit people in the church easily.  The church continues to make us feel very welcome with invitations for afternoon tea and dinner to peoples houses.  We are starting to make some friends which is good.

We're having fun learning about the culture, and making mistakes as we do so.  It seems every time we go to the supermarket we get something new wrong.  We've now had a number of encounters with German bureaucracy, applying for tax numbers, registering our address, and applying for a bank account.  So far these have gone relatively smoothly.  Ordering food at restaurants is getting easier, and we've also found out which cinemas have non dubbed English movies, which gives us a welcome break from German only television.  We're enjoying eating German food, including Currywurst (curried sausage, Beth's favourite), Fleischsalat (meat salad, like potato salad but with ham, James' favourite), as well as the dense breads, cold meats and cheese for breakfast, fruit flavoured teas, top quality yoghurt, and plenty of potatoes.

<em>Thank God that:</em>
<ul>
<li>He has provided James with a great job so easily</li>
<li>The starting date for Beth's course was perfectly timed and she got the last available spot</li>
<li>Oscar Muriu was able to encourage us and the church</li>
<li>People have been very hospitable and have welcomed us warmly</li>
</ul>

<em>Pray that:</em>
<ul>
<li>God would provide for Dan and Nancy a nanny who would be willing to work for little or no pay, someone from overseas would be great</li>
<li>We would maintain good habits and discipline as our lives start to get busy with work and education</li>
<li>Beth would be able to find a job for when her language classes finish</li>
<li>The church restart service on the 11th of September would be a big hit, and begin to attract new people</li>
</ul>

The protestant cathedral in Berlin.  No wonder no one goes to church anymore.
