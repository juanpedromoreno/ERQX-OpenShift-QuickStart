<p>
Just a quick reminder of our prayer and information night this Wednesday night, the 13th of April, from 7:30pm to 9:30pm.  If you haven't heard us talk about why we're going to Germany and what we're doing there, this will be a perfect opportunity to do so.  It will also be a good opportunity to hear about our latest developments in news.
</p>

<p>
We'll also be spending a good amount of time in prayer.  A light supper will be provided.

Address: St Paul's Foyer, 421 Old Northern Rd, Castle Hill

Great God of overflowing grace, move our hearts to pray for Your saving power among the nations.  Burden us with the plight of people who have no access to the gospel.  Grant us to pray big, global, God-sized, Bible-saturated prayers.  Don't let us lose sight of the one lost sheep nearby.  But, O Father, give us a passion for Your worldwide purpose to call Your sheep from every people on the earth.  For the glory of Christ, and in His name we pray, Amen.<br/>
